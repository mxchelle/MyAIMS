# Example Meteor Blog App

This is a very simple example app that uses the [`ryw:blog`](https://github.com/meteor-blog/meteor-blog) package along with bootstrap and iron router. 

<s>You can view it live at [blog-example.meteor.com](http://blog-example.meteor.com)</s>

Meteor no longer offers [free hosting](https://forums.meteor.com/t/meteor-com-free-hosting-ends-march-25-2016/19308?u=hellogerard).  But you can run this app yourself easily by cloning this app and running `meteor`.
